# Light-Object-Detector-System
This project, "Detector System for Light Sources and Object Proximity," is designed to detect light sources and monitor object proximity using an MCU-based system. The system integrates an ultrasonic distance meter and light sensors (LDR) with a servo motor to scan the environment within a 180-degree range. Key functionalities include:
